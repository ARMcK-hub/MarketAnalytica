<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://armck-hub.github.io/MarketAnalytica/)

Market Analytica is an analysis of the top recurring 375 companies within the S&P 500.

The analysis looks at various factors such as top and bottom individual performers as well as a comparison of market sectors during market downturn.

-- Some Limitations --

Note there could be more depending on what you would like to determine with this analysis, but here are some common insights:

* The list of companies used is the current S&P500 list. Note that the list is dynamic and companies move in and out all the time.
* Data was limited to only the 375 stocks that existed for all 20 years called, so it does not include all 500.
* While having a whopping 375 different stocks is great, more stocks should be considered before making significant investments as these only represent the largest of the large-cap companies.
* Up-turn and down-turn periods are defined using peak-to-peak time frame of the S&P 375 index average.
* The rebound period analyzed was from th bottom peak of the End Of Year 2018 dip to the end of data called (present) since there has not be a major flattening or downturn in the market to date.

Here's why Market Analytica is important:
* What kind of Sectors (industries) are present in current the S&P500 and are there some that clearly stand out as winners?
* Are S&P500 stocks gaining value and are they returning increases in value that are beating the rest of the market?
* How popular are these large Market Cap stocks and are they gaining interest from investors?
* What are some of the best and worst performing stocks to invest in?
* What are some of the best and worst performing sectors to invest in?
* When there is economic downturn or rebound, what might be some good things to invest in?
